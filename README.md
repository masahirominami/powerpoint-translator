# üß≠ PowerPoint Translator App

This cross-platform desktop application allows users to **translate the text inside PowerPoint `.pptx` files** into any target language ‚Äî without altering slide layouts, images, or formatting. It uses a simple **PyQt5 GUI** to streamline the process and supports in-place translation to preserve visual fidelity.

**Most of this program was done by Microsoft Copilot.**

## üöÄ Usage`

### Prerequisites:
Prepare config.yaml of your project, where you define forbidden keywords and translation settings.

### Option 1: Using the GUI (recommended)

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```
2. Select the PowerPoint file you want to translate.
3. Choose the target language from the dropdown menu.
4. Click the "Translate" button.

### Option 2: Using the CLI

1. Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. You'll be prompted to enter:

   The input file path
   The output file path
   A target language code

3. The application will process the file and save the translated version.
